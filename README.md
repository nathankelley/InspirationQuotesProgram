# InspirationQuotesProgram
This program will interact with the user to provide inspiration quotes from various books of scripture. Kotlin is the main and only language used here currently. I plan on turning this into an android app where the user can interact similarly, but in a more user-friendly environment. Please feel free to add quotes you may like from scripture. Thank you!
