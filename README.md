# Overview

My goal with this program is to advance my knowledge of Kotlin and turn this program into a simple Android app. These are skills I know I'll 
need in the software development industry.

{Provide a description the software that you wrote to demonstrate the Kotlin language.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
This software in particular is something I've wanted to do for a while. I've always wanted to have an app that could provide me inspiration I relate to.
